        <h1>Harry Collins Athlete Development Case Study</h1>

        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

        <p>This brief aimed to build a service website to sell the services and knowledge of Harry Collins to
            athletes. The content was provided by the client as part of the brief with a short description of pages
            required and a colour scheme to be used throughout.
        </p>


        <h2>Research</h2>

        <p>Desk research was undertaken on other athlete development websites to judge design aspects, as the content
            was provided no content research or production was required.</p>

        <p>Three sites were looked at for design inspiration and motivation, theathletedp.com, jeffnippard.com and a
            design found on Dribbble.com. These sites can be seen in the images below:</p>

        <h2>Pre-design work</h2>

        <p>Before any design creation and iteration was undertaken the images provided by the client were all changed to
            jpeg files, to keep a consistent image format throughout the site. These images were then uploaded to
            tinyjpg.com to compress and optimise them, replacing the original images. This not only optimised the images
            for use throughout the site but also reduced the amount of data used in browsing the site.</p>

        <p>All content provided by the client was also run through Grammarly to check for spelling and grammatical
            errors.</p>

        <h2>Design iteration stage</h2>

        <p>First paper mockups were produced to reflect a rough design of the site at this stage, these were informed
            from the previous desk research findings. A sample of the paper mockups can be seen in the images below:</p>

        <img class="mockups" src="/images/papermockups2.jpeg" alt="Harry Collins home page paper mockup number 2">

        <p>Next, these paper mockups were refined and improved upon by using Figma to produce high-fidelity mockups, an
            extra benefit of using Figma is that CSS properties can be pulled directly from the inspect tab, this helped
            with linear gradients and colour changes on images used in the site. Additionally Zeplin was used to pull
            all the CSS from the Figma designs, this sped up the development process. A sample of these can be seen in
            the images below:</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>

        <p>The site was built using HTML5 and CSS3 (via Sass pre-processing), and this was supplemented via Javascript
            to animate content via CSS and an API being pulled in for the Google Maps implementation in the contact
            area. As this was a single person build for a small brief agile methodology was employed throughout for the
            research, design, build, testing and deployment. A kanban board was used via Trello to keep a track of tasks
            throughout. Version control was used throughout the build process, using Git via Bitbucket.</p>

        <h2>Testing and Validation</h2>

        <p>All the HTML was validated using the W3C validation service at validator.w3.org, to ensure standards were met in the HTML.</p>

        <p>Using the live server plugin in VS Code to run the site, accessibility testing was undertaken to resolve any issues that arose.</p>
